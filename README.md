Technology: HTML,CSS and Vanilla.js
For visualisation i use html5 canvas.

## PreStart Initialization:

+ Pixel scale - scale of 1 cell.
+ Map fill (%) - percentage filling in the case of an arbitrary filling.
+ Frame refresh (ms) - frame rate (similar to speed).
+ If the game is started, the frame rate changes during the entry.

## Controls: 
+ Create Random FirstGen - generates an arbitrary fill of points and displays them on the screen.
+ Create CustomGen - empty field for self-filling.
+ Save Current - saving the current array of points.
+ Stop - stops generating and displays the initial state (unless the status button is pressed).

NextGen - one step forward.

Mouse Position - coordinates of the cursor.

You can add / remove points both during the game and on the pause.
